#Canvas Experiment

The HTML5 introduces a lot of nice things, canvas is one of those.
In first file (arcs) we can draw circles at the screen just clicking and drawing it. Second file (paint) use your webcam to paint the canvas with your screen then you can paint the screen with arcs and images.

These files were build in  a lazy weekend, so enjoy it and use for fun.
